Abstract :
The ionosphere is the propagation medium for radio waves transmitted by an over-the-horizon radar (OTHR). Ionospheric parameters, typically, virtual ionospheric heights (VIHs), are required to perform coordinate registration for OTHR multitarget tracking and localization. The inaccuracy of ionospheric parameters has a significant deleterious effect on the target localization of OTHR. Therefore, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it is important to develop accurate models and estimation methods of ionospheric parameters and the corresponding target tracking algorithms. In this paper, we consider the variation of the ionosphere with location and the spatial correlation of the ionosphere in OTHR target tracking. We use a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) to model the VIHs, providing a more accurate representation of the VIHs for OTHR target tracking. Based on expectation-conditional maximization and GMRF modeling of the VIHs, we propose a novel joint optimization solution, called ECM-GMRF, to perform target state estimation, multipath data association and VIHs estimation simultaneously. In ECM-GMRF, the measurements from both ionosondes and OTHR are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading to a better estimation of the VIHs which improves the accuracy of data association and target state estimation, and vice versa. The simulation indicates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Authors: Mishra B.;Sahoo P.
DOI: 10.1007/s10509-013-1652-6
Abstract :
In this paper, we have investigated Bianchi type VIh, II and III cosmological model with wet dark fluid in scale invariant theory of gravity, where the matter field is in the form of perfect fluid and with a time dependent gauge function (Dirac gauge). A non-singular model for the universe filled with disorder radiation is constructed and some physical behaviors of the model are studied for the feasible VIh (h = 1) space-time.

Title: Multiwavelength Observations of the Black Hole Candidate XTE J1550-564
  during the 2000 Outburst
Authors: Jain R.;Bailyn C.;Orosz J.;McClintock J.;Remillard R.
DOI: 10.1086/321700
Abstract :
We report optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves for the outburst, in 2000, of the black hole candidate XTE J1550-564. We find that the start of the outburst in the H and V bands precedes that seen in the RXTE All Sky Monitor by 11.5 +/- 0.9 and 8.8 +/- 0.6 days, respectively; a similar delay has been observed in two other systems. About 50 days after the primary maxima in the VIH light curves, we find secondary maxima, most prominently in H. This secondary peak is absent in the X-ray light curve, but coincides with a transition to the low/hard state. We suggest that this secondary peak may be due to non-thermal emission associated with the formation of a jet.

Title: Late-time behaviour of the tilted Bianchi type VIh models
Authors: Hervik S;Hoogen R;Lim W;Coley A
DOI: 10.1088/0264-9381/24/15/007
Abstract :
We study tilted perfect fluid cosmological models with a constant equation of state parameter in spatially homogeneous models of Bianchi type VI_h using dynamical systems methods and numerical experimentation, with an emphasis on their future asymptotic evolution. We determine all of the equilibrium points of the type VI_h state space (which correspond to exact self-similar solutions of the Einstein equations, some of which are new), and their stability is investigated. We find that there are vacuum plane-wave solutions that act as future attractors. In the parameter space, a `loophole' is shown to exist in which there are no stable equilibrium points. We then show that a Hopf-bifurcation can occur resulting in a stable closed orbit (which we refer to as the Mussel attractor) corresponding to points both inside the loophole and points just outside the loophole; in the former case the closed curves act as late-time attractors while in the latter case these attracting curves will co-exist with attracting equilibrium points. In the special Bianchi type III case, centre manifold theory is required to determine the future attractors. Comprehensive numerical experiments are carried out to complement and confirm the analytical results presented. We note that the Bianchi type VI_h case is of particular interest in that it contains many different subcases which exhibit many of the different possible future asymptotic behaviours of Bianchi cosmological models.

DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/710/2/1127
Abstract :
We analyze photometry of the Soft X-ray Transient A0620-00 spanning nearly 30 years, including previously published and previously unpublished data. Previous attempts to determine the inclination of A0620 using subsets of these data have yielded a wide range of measured values of i. Differences in the measured value of i have been due to changes in the shape of the light curve and uncertainty regarding the contamination from the disk. We give a new technique for estimating the disk fraction and find that disk light is significant in all light curves, even in the infrared. We also find that all changes in the shape and normalization of the light curve originate in a variable disk component. After accounting for this disk component, we find that all the data, including light curves of significantly different shapes, point to a consistent value of i. Combining results from many separate data sets, we find i=51 plus or minus 0.9 degrees, implying M=6.6 plus or minus 0.25 solar masses. Using our dynamical model and zero-disk stellar VIH magnitudes, we find d=1.06 plus or minus 0.12 kpc. Understanding the disk origin of non-ellipsoidal variability may assist with making reliable determinations of i in other systems, and the fluctuations in disk light may provide a new observational tool for understanding the three-dimensional structure of the accretion disk.

Abstract :
A central challenge in high throughput density functional theory (HT-DFT) calculations is selecting a combination of input parameters and post-processing techniques that can be used across all materials classes, while also managing accuracy-cost tradeoffs. To investigate the effects of these parameter choices, we consolidate three large HT-DFT databases: Automatic-FLOW (AFLOW), the Materials Project (MP), and the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), and compare reported properties across each pair of databases for materials calculated using the same initial crystal structure. We find that HT-DFT formation energies and volumes are generally more reproducible than band gaps and total magnetizations; for instance, a notable fraction of records disagree on whether a material is metallic (up to 7%) or magnetic (up to 15%). The variance between calculated properties is as high as 0.105 eV/atom (median relative absolute difference, or MRAD, of 6%) for formation energy, 0.65 {\AA}$^3$/atom (MRAD of 4%) for volume, 0.21 eV (MRAD of 9%) for band gap, and 0.15 $\mu_{\rm B}$/formula unit (MRAD of 8%) for total magnetization, comparable to the differences between DFT and experiment. We trace some of the larger discrepancies to choices involving pseudopotentials, the DFT+U formalism, and elemental reference states, and argue that further standardization of HT-DFT would be beneficial to reproducibility.

Abstract
The ionosphere is the propagation medium for radio waves transmitted by an over-the-horizon radar (OTHR). Ionospheric parameters,
typically, virtual ionospheric heights (VIHs), are required to perform coordinate registration for OTHR multitarget tracking and
localization. The inaccuracy of ionospheric parameters ha s a signicant deleterious e

ect on the target localization of OTHR.
Therefore, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it is important to develop accurate models and estimation methods of
ionospheric parameters and the corresponding target tracking algorithms. In this paper, we consider the variation of the ionosphere
with location and the spatial correlation of the ionosphere in OTHR target tracking. We use a Gaussian Markov random eld (GMRF)
to model the VIHs, providing a more accurate representation of the VIHs for OTHR target tracking. Based on expectation-conditional
maximization and GMRF modeling of the VIHs, we propose a novel joint optimization solution, called ECM-GMRF, to perform
target state estimation, multipath data association and VIHs estimation simultaneously. In ECM-GMRF, the measurements from both
ionosondes and OTHR are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading to a better estimation of the VIHs which improves the accuracy of
data association and target state estimation, and vice versa. The simulation indicates the e

1. Introduction
On account of many advantages such as the ability to detect
and track targets at long ranges (typically 800 km to 3
;
000 km)
beyond the earth's horizon with comparatively low operation
cost, skywave over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) has become in-
creasingly important for both civil and military applications,
such as maritime reconnaissance and drug enforcement [
1
,
2
].
As a medium and acting as a reector for reecting electro-
magnetic waves, the earth's ionosphere makes OTHR break
the limitation of radar horizon. However, the propagation of
electromagnetic waves through the inherent complicated iono-
sphere brings about a coordinate registration (CR) [
3
] process
for OTHR target tracking, since target locations in ground coor-
dinate system (i.e., latitude and longitude) are needed but OTHR
receives measurements in slant coordinate system (i.e., slant
azimuth and slant range). To carry out CR, ionospheric parame-
ters that describe the geometric transformation between ground
coordinate system and slant coordinate system, such as virtual
ionospheric heights (VIHs), are required [
4
,
5
]. Location error
analysis of OTHR shows that inaccuracy of ionospheric param-
eters is a main source of the localization error of OTHR [
6
].
Accordingly, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it
is important to develop accurate models and estimation methods
for ionospheric parameters (e.g., VIHs) and the corresponding

target tracking algorithms. In this context, the existing OTHR
target tracking approaches can be classied into the following
four groups.
The approaches in the rst group assumed that each layer
of the ionosphere is an ideal mirror, and the VIH of each
layer is a known constant. Focusing on the multipath data
association problem caused by the multilayer structure of the
ionosphere, these approaches include the multipath proba-
bilistic data association (MPDA) [
4
], the multiple detection
multiple hypothesis tracker (MD-MHT) [
7
], the expectation-
maximization (EM)-based joint multipath data association
and state estimation (JMAE) [
8
], the multipath Bernoulli
lter (MPBF) [
9
], the multidetection probability hypothesis
density (MD-PHD) lter [
10
,
11
], and the multipath linear
multitarget integrated probabilistic data association (MP-LM-
IPDA) [12].
The second group, including [
13
] and [
14
], assumed that
the VIH of each layer is an unknown constant. This being the
case, it is necessary to exploit a joint optimization scheme that
solves target state estimation, multipath data association, and
VIHs identication. Specically, the former, [
13
], resorted to
sensor fusion of OTHR and a set of forward-based receivers;
the latter, [
14
], adopted a distributed expectation-conditional
maximization (ECM) framework.
The approaches in the third group made the assumption that
the VIH(s) of each layer is (are) a random variable or a ran-
dom process in time. The improvement of reliability on the

 approaches is achieved by incorporating the uncertainty of VIHs
into the tracking algorithms. Examples of this group include the
MPDA for uncertain coordinate registration (MPCR) where the
VIH of each layer follows a Gaussian distribution with known
mean and variance [
5
], the multi-hypothesis multipath track fu-
sion (MPTF) where VIHs evolve with a linear dynamics model
and Gaussian distribution [
15
], and the joint estimation of tar-
get state and the bias of VIHs where VIHs are summation of
known, nominal VIHs provided by ionosondes and unknown,
time-varying bias [
16
,
17
]. In [
16
], by introducing the intermit-
tently evolving dynamic model for the bias of VIHs, the joint
estimation problem was reformulated as a multi-rate state esti-
mation with random coe

cient matrices. In [
17
], modeling the
bias of VIHs via a Markovian jump model, the joint estimation
problem was converted to pure state estimate with stochastic
parameters by embedding the data association in the resultant
measurement model with random coe

cients. Bo th of the two
joint estimation problems were solved by the deduced linear min-
imum mean square error estimator with causality constraints.
Few work, belongs to the fourth group, considered full iono-
spheric models. The parameters of the full ionospheric models,
for example, critical frequency, height at the base of the layer
and at the top, were assumed to be known. In [
18
,
19
], the multi-
quasi-parabolic model was used in CR of OTHR Nostradamus
target tracking. In [
20
], a maximum-likelihood probabilistic
multihypothesis tracker for OTHR was presented, where a 3-D
ionospheric regional model from the International Reference
Ionosphere (IRI) was used and the signal refraction in the iono-
sphere was modeled by ray-tracing.
The assumption of location independence of VIHs made by
the rst three groups signicantly simplied OTHR target track-
ing. However, it is far from being accurate since the ionosphere
is a spatiotemporal process. The VIHs of each layer in a large
region are apparently di

erent in di

erent locations. The work
of th e fourth group considered the location dependency of the
ionosphere through the full io nospheric models. However, the
properties of the ionosphere as a spatiotemporal process, such
as spatial correlation, were not fully considered.
Much work, especially on total electron contents (TECs) and
electron density, has shown that the ionosphere is spatially cor-
related. In the early stage, it was discovered that the ionosphere
is horizontally spatially correlated. In [
21
], it was found that
TECs are highly correlata ble in two locations separated by 13

in latitude and 5

in longitude. In [
22
], the spatial correlation
coe

cients of TECs was calculated, based on which it is pos-
sible to predict mid-latitude TECs behavior over separations of
up to 1200 km given a single TECs measurement. The corre-
lation for mid-latitude ionosphere over the Western U.S. was
showed in [
23
]. Later, the spatial correlation of the ionosphere
including both the horizontal and the vertical correlation was
investigated [
24
]. Krankowski et al. [
25
] summarized that the
correlation distance of ionosphere depends on direction and it
is anisotropic. Arikan [
26
] applied random eld theory to iono-
spheric electron density reconstruction problem and discussed
the choice of correlation functions. Minkwitz et al. [
27
] pro-
posed an approach that estimates the electron density's spatial
covariance model which reveals the di

erent correlation lengths
in latitude and longitude direction. Liu et al. [
28
] investigated the
horizontal spatial correlation of globally ionospheric TECs. The
correlation scale was compared from the aspects of direction,
latitude and season. Norberg et al. [
29
,
30
,
31
] proposed a new
ionospheric tomography method in Bayesian framework which
enables an interpretable scheme to build the prior distribution
based on physical and empirical information on the structure of
the ionosphere for 2D case [
29
,
30
] and 3D multi-instrument
case [
31
]. In ionospheric weather forecast, an accurate correla-
tion model of the ionosphere is used to constru ct background
eld error covariance matrix for data assimilation.
In this paper, we consider the variation of the ionosphere with
location and the spatial correlation of the ionosphere in OTHR
target tracking. Like the approaches of the rst three groups,
we use VIHs as the key parameters in CR. It is not unnatural to
assume that VIHs are location dependent. The assumption of
the spatial correlation of VIHs is based upon the s patial corre-
lation of the above-mentioned electron density and TECs, and
the dependence of VIHs on them. As an example of this depen-
dence, given an operating frequency of OTHR, VIHs are linear
with the height where electron density is maximum in parabolic
layer model [
32
]. Our purpose to consider the variation of the
ionosphere with location and the spatial correlation of the iono-
sphere is to create a model that more accurately represents the
ionosphere in OTHR target tracking and therefore improve the
localization error of OTHR. In practice, assuming a constant
VIH for the ionosphere will unavoidably br ing about a signif-
icant localization error for OTHR. To estimate VIHs online, a
network of available ionosondes, including, for example, verti-
cal ionosondes, quasi-vertical ionosondes, oblique ionosondes,
are deploy ed [
3
]. However, since the deployment of ionoson-
des is restricted to available areas and costs operators capital
expenditures and operating expenses, meas urements of V IHs on
very limited locations are obtained. By considering the spatial
correlation of VIHs, we are able to infer or predict the VIHs of
the ionosphere acting as a reection area more accurately.
We use a discrete Gaussian Markov random eld (GMRF) to
model the variation of VIHs with location and the spatial corre-
lation of VIHs. Based on this model, we then propose a joint
tracking algorithm using ECM-based technique for joint data
association, target state estimation, and VIHs identication. In
this algorithm, we use not only the measurements of VIHs from
ionosondes but also the measurements of targets from OTHR
to estimate VIHs since the latter also include the information
on VIHs. By modeling VIHs as a GMRF, we are able to infer
the VIHs at the locations where the signal reection occurs for
a given target. A better estimation of VIHs can improve the
accuracy of data association and target state estimation, and
vice versa. As pointed out in [
14
], joint data association and
target state estimation are e

ective for dealing with the coupling
issue of identication risks and estimation errors [
14
]. Note
that [
14
] considered the single target tracking. In summary, the
contributions of this paper beyond [14] are as follows:
1.
For the rst time, we consider the variation of the iono-
sphere with location and the spatial correlation of iono-
sphere in OTHR target tracking. We use GMRF to model
2
 the VIHs of the ionosphere, providing a more accurate
representation of VIHs for OTHR target tracking.
2.
Using ECM, we propose a joint multitarget tracking frame-
work for data association, target state estimation and VIHs
estimation. Leveraging GMRF modeling of the VIHs of
the ionosphere, we use both the ionosonde measurements
and the radar measurements to estimate the target state and
the VIHs, improving target localization accuracy of OTHR.
Our preliminary work was presented in [
33
] and has been sub-
stantially extended in this study. In [
33
], we to ok into account of
spatial correlation of the VIHs and inferred the posterior distribu-
tion of the VIHs based on GMRF. Then, the estimated VIHs was
passed to the existing MPCR algorithm for single target tracking.
In this paper, we integrate the propose d VIHs model with the
ECM framework, where radar measurements are also utilized
to estimate VIHs. Additionally, the multitarget multi-detection
pattern is presented for multitarget data association. The de-
tailed imp le mentation for inferring the posterior distribution of
the VIHs over large scale regions is also presented.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
consists of the assumptions and models for OTHR target tracking.
The detailed derivation of the proposed algorithm, ECM-GMRF,
is depicted in Section 3. Simulation results are presented in
Section 4 followed by concluding remarks in Section 5.

2. Models and problem formulation
In this section, we describe the models we introduce for VIHs,
ionosonde measurements, target dynamics, and radar measure-
ment. Based on the models, we provide a formulation of our
OTHR multitarget multipath tracking problem.
2.1. Model of VIHs
Without loss of generality, a two-layer (E and F) spherical
mirror ionosphere is assumed. The ionosphere region to be used
for signal reection depends on the wide surveillance area of
OTHR, and is correspondingly large. The VIHs at di

erent
locations are di

erent due to the di

erent characteristics of the
earth's magnetic eld [
34
]. Based upon the existing work on the
ionospheric spatial correlation [
21
,
35
,
27
] (See more details in
Section 1), we assume that there exists horizontal correlation of
VIHs but do not consider the vertical correlation of VIHs for
simplicity. Since, in short time periods, the correlation strength
of the ionosphere at two di

erent sites la rgely depends on the
distance between them, which corresponds to the local Markov
property [
36
], VIHs can be modeled as a Markov random eld.
As described in [
29
,
30
,
31
], which assumed that electron density
and TECs are Gaussian, we assume that the VIHs are Gaussian
as well. Accordingly, we use a discrete Gaussian Markov ran-
dom eld (GMRF) to describe the VIHs of both E layer and F
layer.
Specically, we take E layer as an example to illustrate our
GMRF description of VIHs. We associate E layer with an undi-
rected graph
G
=
(
V
;
E
), where
V
=
f
1
;
2
; : : : ;
N
g
is the set of
nodes in the graph, and
E
is the set of edges (
i
;
j
),
i
;
j
2 V
and
i
,
j
. Denote
h
i
2
R
+
;
i
2 V
as the VIH of E layer at site
i
.
Henceforth,
N
is the number of sites of E layer. Let
h
=
f
h
i
g
N
i
=
1
.
We assume that
h
˘ N


is the covariance matrix. Let
Q
= 

1
and

=

.
Q
,

are
called precision matrix and potential vector, respectively. The
random vector of VIHs
h
is dened as a discrete GMRF
w. r. t.

G

and precision matrix
Q

and only if its density has the form [37]

and
Q
i j
,
0 is equivalent to (
i

j
)
2 E
for all
i
,
j
. Therefore, two
VIHs at two di

erent sites
i
and
j
are spatially correlated if there
exists an edge
e
=
(
i
;
j
)
2 E
and vice versa. For a GMRF, it is
often more convenient to work with the canonical (information)
form, which is dened as [37]

In principle, the priors of the GMRF model, including the
mean vector

, the covariance matrix

, the potential vector

, and the precision matrix
Q
, can be learned from historical
measurements of VIHs by the standard maximum likelihood
estimator. However, for a large-scale sparse precision matrix
Q
,
one may need more e

ective learning method [
38
]. We leave
the learning of the GMRF model as our future work and assume
that the priors are given in this paper.
2.2. Model of ionosonde measurement
The vertical incidence ionospheric sounding and the oblique
incidence ionospheric sounding are two typical types of ionoson-
des. We assume that OTHR measurement and ionosonde mea-
surement are synchronized. By assuming stationary electron
density for the given time interval [
31
], the ionosonde measure-
ments of each site of each layer can be written as,
z
s
i
;
k
=
g
(
h
s
i
;
k
)
+
v
s
k
;
s
=
E, F and
i
=
1
; : : : ;
N
;
(3)
where
z
s
i
;
k
is the time delay. It is assumed that
v
s
k
is a zero mean
Gaussian noise, i.e.,
v
s
k
˘ N
(0
;
A
s
k
). The measurement function
g
(

) depends on the type of ionosondes. For a vertical incidence
ionosonde, the measurement is linearly related to the VIHs [
39
],
g
(
h
)
=
2
h
c
;
(4)
where
c
is the light speed. For an oblique incidence ionosonde
with a simplied model of a at ionosphere over a at Earth, the
measurement function is [40],
g
(
h
)
=
2
p
h
2
+
(
¯
d
=
2)
2
c
;
(5)
3
 where
¯
d
is the distance from the transmitter of the ionosonde to
the receiver of the ionosonde.
We here emphasize that because of the wide-area surveil-
lance of OTHR, the geographical limitation of the placement of
ionosondes, and the construction and operation cost of ionoson-
des, only some sites of the ionosphere are measured by ionoson-
des. The required VIHs may not be measured directly by the
ionosondes. We will discuss this later in Section 3.4.
2.3. Model of target dynamics
Assume that there are
L
targets in the surveillance area of
OTHR. The state of target
l
(
l
=
1
; : : : ;
L
) at scan
k
is written
as
x

k

ˆ
l

;
b
l
k
;


T
, corresponding to ground range, ground
range rate, bearing and bearing rate of the target. The dynamics
of each target is assumed to follow a d is crete-time state equation
written as

f
l
(

)

. The symbol

2.4. Model of OTHR measurement
With two ionospheric layers E and F, there are four one-hop
propagation modes, EE, EF, FE and FF. For each mode, we as-
sume that the measurement of a target is obtained independently
with known detection probability

is the distance from the transmitter of OTHR to the

mode

t
and
h
r
in Eq. (8) are replaced with the VIHs at the
sites where OTHR beam reects from the transmitter to the
target and the receiving beam reects from the target to the
receiver, respectively.
As [
4
], we assume that clutter distributes uniformly in the
region of interest and the number of clutter follows a Poisson
distribution with density

. For a given number of false clutter
measurements
N

, the Poisson model can be written as

where

is the volume of the measurement space.

2.5. Problem statement
Taking EF propagation mode as an example, Fig. 2 depicts
the synthesis of our models on VIHs, ionosonde measurement,
target and OTHR measurement. Unlike the existing OTHR track-
ing algorithms mentioned in Section 1, we rene the description
of VIHs by dividing each layer of the ionosphere into smaller
subregions and modeling it by a GMRF. As we mentioned in
Section 2.2, a very limited number of subregions are observed by
ionosondes. The subregions where the OTHR signal is reected
may not be observed by any ionosondes. By modeling the VIHs
of each layer as a GMRF, we are able to infer the VIHs of un-
observed subregions and improve the estimation of the VIHs of
observed sub regions by jointly using both OTHR measurements
and ionosonde measurements, leading to the reduction of the
VIHs error and the improvement of target state estimation in
return.

i
t
denotes the
subregion where the OTHR beam reects from the transmitter to
the target, and
i
r
denotes the subregion where the OTHR beam
reects from the target to the receiver. As shown in Fig. 1,
i
t
and
i
r
are determined by geometric transforms among radar sta-
tions, target location and VIHs. The indexing of the subregions
corresponding to each propagation mode is shown in Table 1.
Given the models of VIHs, ionosonde measurement, target
dynamics, and radar measurement, the aim of a tracker is to
estimate target states sequences

In Problem 1, there are two di

culties that prevent it from
being solved directly. The rst one is the unknown data associ-
ation (called
missing data
)

k


:
k
, that is, the correspondence
among a target, a measurement and a propagation path is not
known. This means that the radar measurement is
incomplete
data
. The second one is the above-mentioned coupling of the
target state and the used VIHs. EM, which works iteratively, is
an e

ective way to deal with the MAP estimation problem with
missing data [
41
]. Each iteration of EM involves an expecta-
tion step (E-step), which creates a function for the expectation
of the log-likelihood evaluated using current estimation for the
parameters, and a maximization step (M-step), which computes
parameters by maximizing the function formulated in the E-step.
EM has provided performance improvement for OTHR target
tracking [
42
,
8
,
14
] although the GMRF model of VIHs was not
considered. In this paper, we leverage EM framework as well
and develop the OTHR multitarget tracking algorithm. We next
will describe the details of the proposed algorithm.
3. OTHR multitarget tracking
As we mentioned in Section 2.5, in the EM framework, OTHR
measurements are incomplete data due to the unknown data
association. Both OTHR measurements and ionosonde mea-
surements contain the information on the used VIHs. For a
clear representation, below we rename each variables in the EM
framework:

Step 6:
Check for the convergence of either the parameters
or the log likelihood. If the convergence criterion is not
fullled, let
r
=
r
+
1 and go back to Step 2.
The goal of the M-step (i.e.,
Step 5
) is to maximize Eq. (14)
over parameters
x
k


:
k
and

k



. However, due to the high
dimensional parameter space and the coupling of the target

To this end, the diagram of our proposed algorithm, ECM-
GMRF, is shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, the modules in orange
dotted box represent the entire ECM process. The E-step, in-
cluding the using of multitarget multidetection pattern and the
calculation of the posterior distribution of each association event,
is represented by
data association
block. The
target state esti-
mation
block corresponds to Eq. (15), i.e., the rst step of the
CM-step. The red dotted box represents the second step of the
CM-step, i.e., Eq. (16).
Figure 3: The diagram of ECM-GMRF.
In the rest of this section, we will present the multitarget
multidetection pattern and dene data association events in Sec-
tion 3.1. Next we will specify the derivation of E-step in Sec-
tion 3.2. Then we will elaborate the above two CM-steps, i.e.,
target state estimation and inference of VIHs, in Section 3.3 and
Section 3.4, respectively.
3.1. Data association
In OTHR, the data association uncertainties include the un-
known number of target-originated measurements for each tar-
get, the unknown measurement source as well as the unknown
measurement mode. We here extend the multidetection pat-
tern in [
45
] to multitarget case. The multitarget multidetection
pattern is formulated with the following assumptions:

One measurement can only be associated with at most one
target through a propagation mode.

For each target, at most one measurement can be generated
through a propagation mode.
Assume that there are
N
m
;
k
OTHR measurements at scan
k
.
For the sake of simplicity, we omit the time subscript in the
following description within th is subsection. We have following
denitions.
Denition 1.

, we need to infer the posterior
marginal distribution of the each used VIH; this is a typical infer-
ence problem on probabilistic graphical models. For Gaussian
graphical models of moderate size, exact inference can be solved
by algorithms such as direct matrix inversion, Choles ky factor-
ization, and nested dissection. However, these algorithms cannot
be used for large-scale problems due to the computational com-
plexity [
49
]. Exploiting the structure of the GMRF, the
message
passing
approach can signicantly reduce the computational
cost and is adopted to infer the VIHs.
Fig. 4 shows the message passing ow for the used VIHs for
one target. The VIH of E layer and the VIH of F layer are linked
through the OTHR measurements generated by propagation
mode EF and FE. We combine two GMRFs into one, i.e.,
E

4. Simulation and analysis
In this section, numerical simulations are implemented to
verify the performance of ECM-GMRF. We compare ECM-
GMRF with MD-JPDAF [
45
]. The statistical results of the two
algorithms are based on 400 Monte Carlo runs.
4.1. Scenario settings
As shown in Fig. 1, we use the same settings for OTHR as
described in [
4
], such as surveillance region size, measurement
noise level and sampling period. We assume that there are ve
targets in the surveillance region of OTHR. Fig. 5 shows the true
trajectories of the ve targets in radar ground coordinate system.
To model the ionosphere by a GMRF, without loss of general-
ity, for each layer of the ionosphere, we divide the corresponding
ionosphere region
A
into 144 subregions as illustrated in Fig. 6.
The subregions of the used VIHs are determined by the geometry

the indices (E layer and F layer) of the subregions of the used
VIHs are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. To directly
measure VIHs, we assume that there are two vertical incidence
ionospheric sounding ionosondes which are located underneath
the subregion 1 and the subregion 73, respectively. Table 2

targets.

Next, we rst run ECM-GMRF only to analyze its perfor-
mance considering a single target (e.g., Target 1) tracking in
Section 4.2. Then we explore the improvements of the used
VIH estimation and the target state estimation when multiple
targets are tracked, and compare ECM-GMRF with MD-JPDAF
in Section 4.3.
4.2. Single target tracking results
Firstly, we let

(slide window) of ECM-GMRF be one and
consider the following three cases with di

erent information
sources on VIHs.

Case 1: The VIHs of layer E and layer F are xed at 110 km
and 220 km, respectively.

Case 2: Only the measurements from ionosondes are used
to estimate the used VIHs.

Case 3: Both the measurements from ionosondes and the
measurements from OTHR are used to estimate the used
VIHs.
The statistical results of VIHs estimation and target state esti-
mation obtained by ECM-GMRF are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9,
respectively. For comparison, the results of VIHs estimation
and target state estimation with true data association are also
presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.
From Fig. 8, it is seen that using ionosonde measure-
ments (Case 2 and Case 3) can signicantly reduce the estimation
error of VIHs comparing with using constant VIHs (Case 1). By
observing the RMSE curves of VIHs of Case 2 and Case 3, it is

concluded that, as we expected, using the additional measure-
ments of the target from OTHR can improve the estimation of
VIHs as well, especially for
h
F
(
i
t
)
and
h
F
(
i
r
)
. The di

erence
in the increase of the used VIHs of the E layer and the F layer
is due to the di

erence in the values and parameters of the two
layers. For example, the linearization errors in Eq. (54) for mode
EE and mode FF are di

erent due to the di

erent values of the
two layers. The results in Fig. 8 verify our standpoints by the
following facts. The comparison between Case 1 and Case 2
shows that the correlation among the VIHs contributes to the
estimation of the used VIH. Fig. 6 shows that the used VIHs are
not directly measured by ionosondes. The comparison between
Case 2 and Case 3 shows that OTHR measurements are helpful
to the estimation of the used VIHs.
Figure 9: Statistical results of target state estimation with di

erent information
source on the VIHs: ground range (left panel) and bearing (right panel).
The RMSE curves of VIHs of Case 3 with true data asso-
ciation and gate data association indicate that erroneous data
association indeed occurred to ECM-GMRF using gate data as-
sociation and it can deteriorate the estimation performance of
ECM-GMRF on VIHs. Note that since the temporal correlation
of VIHs is not considered in this p aper, the estimation accuracy
of VIHs has not been improved with the accumulation of (both
OTHR and ionosonde) measurements over time.
12
 By observing the RMSE curves of ground range and bearing
for all the three cases in Fig. 9 and the above analysis of VIHs
estimation based on Fig. 8, we conclude that better estimation of
VIHs is benecial to target state estimation. The mean RMSE of
the ground range of the three cases using gate data association
are 1.97 km, 1.44 km and 1.3 km, respectively; the improvement
ratio of Case 2 and Case 3 over Case 1 are 26.7% and 33.7%,
respectively. Overall, joint estimation of target state and VIHs
using both OTHR measurements and ionosonde measurements
can greatly improve the estimation accuracy of the used VIHs
as well as the target state.
Next, the performance of ECM-GMRF with di

erent se-
quence length

is explored. We run ECM-GMRF on Case
3 with gate data association. The statistical results of target state
estimation and the used VIHs estimation are shown in Fig. 10
and Fig. 11, from which it can be seen that as

increases, the
accuracy of target state estimation increases since more measure-
ments have been used. When

=
30, the RMSE of the ground
range of the target approaches 1 km. Note that a greater

means
a greater output delay of a tracker.

4.3. Multitarget tracking results
In order to compare ECM-GMRF with MD-JPDAF and verify
the performance improvement on a target brought by using the
OTHR measurements of other targets which is achieved indi-
rectly by the improved VIHs used by the target, we consider the
following three cases.

Case 4: MD-JPDAF is performed for target tracking. The
VIHs of layer E and layer F are xed at 110 km and 220 km,
respectively.

Case 5: Each target is tracked individually using ECM-
GMRF.

Case 6: All the targets are tracked simultaneously using
ECM-GMRF.
The parameter settings remain unchanged in Table 2 and

=
30
for ECM-GMRF.
Fig. 12 shows the comparison of the used VIHs estimation
obtained by ECM-GMRF for each target under Case 5, Case
6 and the case that only ionosonde measurements are used to
estimate the used VIHs. In Fig. 12, the green curves represent
the RMSE of the estimated VIHs by only using ionosonde mea-
surements

, the red curves represent the RMSE of the estimated
VIHs by using ionosonde measurements

and OTHR measure-
ments
Y
when targets are tracked individually (i.e., Case 5), and
the blue curves represent the RMSE of the estimated VIHs by
using ionosonde measurements
Z
and OTHR measurements
Y
when targets are tracked simultaneously. From Fig. 12, it is seen
that comparing with only using ionosonde measurements, using
both ionosonde measurements and OTHR measurements can
improve the estimation of VIHs, especially when all the targets
are tracked simultaneously since OTHR measurements of all
targets are used to infer the used VIHs through the GMRF model.
In the GMRF model we constructed, the closer the subregions
are, the stronger the correlation is. As we can see from Fig. 5,
the targets move toward the same point and they are very close
around scan 15 as well as the VIHs. Correspondingly, the lowest
value of the estimated RMSE of VIHs when tracking simulta-
neously (i.e., the green curve) in Fig. 12 is at around scan 15.
Table 3 shows the RMSE mean values (km) of each curves of
30 scans in Fig. 12, and the improvement ratios compared with
the standard deviations of the VIHs.
For the evaluation of target tracking accuracy, Fig. 13 depicts
the RMSEs for the range estimation and bearing estimation of
the targets under di

erent cases. As we can see in Fig. 13, for all
targets, the estimation result of Case 6 is the best. The tracking
accuracy of Case 5 is slightly worse than that of Case 6. Using
the OTHR measurements of targets simultaneously can improve
the tracking accuracy up to 9
:
95% for all targets averagely. ECM-
GMRF performs better than MD-JPDAF (Case 4) under both
Case 5 and Case 6. The smoother in the ECM-GMRF improves
the tracking accuracy. Intuitively, since the target state and the
VIHs are coupled in the radar measurement function, accurate
estimation of the VIHs leads to improvement of the target state
estimation.

5. Conclusion
We have addressed the problem of OTHR target state esti-
mation and VIHs identication taking account of the variation
of the VIHs with location and the spatial correlation of the
VIHs. We have used GMRF to model the VIHs. The prob-
lem has been formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation
problem based on both OTHR measurements and ionosonde
measurements. By applying ECM, we have proposed a joint
joint optimization algorithm to perform target state estimation,
multipath data association and VIHs estimation simultaneously.
In our proposed algorithm, both ionosonde measurements and
OTHR measurements are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading
to the reduction of the VIHs error and the improvement of target
state estimation in return. For future work, we plan to develop
learning algorithms for the GMRF model and investigate the

In this paper, we have investigated Bianchi type VIh, II and III cosmological model with wet dark fluid in scale invariant theory of gravity, where the matter field is in the form of perfect fluid and with a time dependent gauge function (Dirac gauge). A non-singular model for the universe filled with disorder radiation is constructed and some physical behaviors of the model are studied for the feasible VIh (h = 1) space-time.

Title: Multiwavelength Observations of the Black Hole Candidate XTE J1550-564
  during the 2000 Outburst
Authors: Jain R.;Bailyn C.;Orosz J.;McClintock J.;Remillard R.
DOI: 10.1086/321700
Abstract :
We report optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves for the outburst, in 2000, of the black hole candidate XTE J1550-564. We find that the start of the outburst in the H and V bands precedes that seen in the RXTE All Sky Monitor by 11.5 +/- 0.9 and 8.8 +/- 0.6 days, respectively; a similar delay has been observed in two other systems. About 50 days after the primary maxima in the VIH light curves, we find secondary maxima, most prominently in H. This secondary peak is absent in the X-ray light curve, but coincides with a transition to the low/hard state. We suggest that this secondary peak may be due to non-thermal emission associated with the formation of a jet.

Title: Late-time behaviour of the tilted Bianchi type VIh models
Authors: Hervik S;Hoogen R;Lim W;Coley A
DOI: 10.1088/0264-9381/24/15/007
Abstract :
We study tilted perfect fluid cosmological models with a constant equation of state parameter in spatially homogeneous models of Bianchi type VI_h using dynamical systems methods and numerical experimentation, with an emphasis on their future asymptotic evolution. We determine all of the equilibrium points of the type VI_h state space (which correspond to exact self-similar solutions of the Einstein equations, some of which are new), and their stability is investigated. We find that there are vacuum plane-wave solutions that act as future attractors. In the parameter space, a `loophole' is shown to exist in which there are no stable equilibrium points. We then show that a Hopf-bifurcation can occur resulting in a stable closed orbit (which we refer to as the Mussel attractor) corresponding to points both inside the loophole and points just outside the loophole; in the former case the closed curves act as late-time attractors while in the latter case these attracting curves will co-exist with attracting equilibrium points. In the special Bianchi type III case, centre manifold theory is required to determine the future attractors. Comprehensive numerical experiments are carried out to complement and confirm the analytical results presented. We note that the Bianchi type VI_h case is of particular interest in that it contains many different subcases which exhibit many of the different possible future asymptotic behaviours of Bianchi cosmological models.

Title: The Inclination of the Soft X-ray Transient A0620--00 and the Mass of
  its Black Hole
Authors: Cantrell Andrew;Bailyn Charles;Orosz Jerome;McClintock Jeffrey;Remillard Ronald;Froning Cynthia;Neilsen Joseph;Gelino Dawn;Gou Lijun
DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/710/2/1127
Abstract :
We analyze photometry of the Soft X-ray Transient A0620-00 spanning nearly 30 years, including previously published and previously unpublished data. Previous attempts to determine the inclination of A0620 using subsets of these data have yielded a wide range of measured values of i. Differences in the measured value of i have been due to changes in the shape of the light curve and uncertainty regarding the contamination from the disk. We give a new technique for estimating the disk fraction and find that disk light is significant in all light curves, even in the infrared. We also find that all changes in the shape and normalization of the light curve originate in a variable disk component. After accounting for this disk component, we find that all the data, including light curves of significantly different shapes, point to a consistent value of i. Combining results from many separate data sets, we find i=51 plus or minus 0.9 degrees, implying M=6.6 plus or minus 0.25 solar masses. Using our dynamical model and zero-disk stellar VIH magnitudes, we find d=1.06 plus or minus 0.12 kpc. Understanding the disk origin of non-ellipsoidal variability may assist with making reliable determinations of i in other systems, and the fluctuations in disk light may provide a new observational tool for understanding the three-dimensional structure of the accretion disk.

Abstract :
A central challenge in high throughput density functional theory (HT-DFT) calculations is selecting a combination of input parameters and post-processing techniques that can be used across all materials classes, while also managing accuracy-cost tradeoffs. To investigate the effects of these parameter choices, we consolidate three large HT-DFT databases: Automatic-FLOW (AFLOW), the Materials Project (MP), and the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), and compare reported properties across each pair of databases for materials calculated using the same initial crystal structure. We find that HT-DFT formation energies and volumes are generally more reproducible than band gaps and total magnetizations; for instance, a notable fraction of records disagree on whether a material is metallic (up to 7%) or magnetic (up to 15%). The variance between calculated properties is as high as 0.105 eV/atom (median relative absolute difference, or MRAD, of 6%) for formation energy, 0.65 {\AA}$^3$/atom (MRAD of 4%) for volume, 0.21 eV (MRAD of 9%) for band gap, and 0.15 $\mu_{\rm B}$/formula unit (MRAD of 8%) for total magnetization, comparable to the differences between DFT and experiment. We trace some of the larger discrepancies to choices involving pseudopotentials, the DFT+U formalism, and elemental reference states, and argue that further standardization of HT-DFT would be beneficial to reproducibility.

Title: OTHR multitarget tracking with a GMRF model of ionospheric parameters

DOI: nan
Abstract :
The ionosphere is the propagation medium for radio waves transmitted by an over-the-horizon radar (OTHR). Ionospheric parameters, typically, virtual ionospheric heights (VIHs), are required to perform coordinate registration for OTHR multitarget tracking and localization. The inaccuracy of ionospheric parameters has a significant deleterious effect on the target localization of OTHR. Therefore, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it is important to develop accurate models and estimation methods of ionospheric parameters and the corresponding target tracking algorithms. In this paper, we consider the variation of the ionosphere with location and the spatial correlation of the ionosphere in OTHR target tracking. We use a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) to model the VIHs, providing a more accurate representation of the VIHs for OTHR target tracking. Based on expectation-conditional maximization and GMRF modeling of the VIHs, we propose a novel joint optimization solution, called ECM-GMRF, to perform target state estimation, multipath data association and VIHs estimation simultaneously. In ECM-GMRF, the measurements from both ionosondes and OTHR are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading to a better estimation of the VIHs which improves the accuracy of data association and target state estimation, and vice versa. The simulation indicates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract
The ionosphere is the propagation medium for radio waves transmitted by an over-the-horizon radar (OTHR). Ionospheric parameters,
typically, virtual ionospheric heights (VIHs), are required to perform coordinate registration for OTHR multitarget tracking and
localization. The inaccuracy of ionospheric parameters ha s a signicant deleterious e

ect on the target localization of OTHR.
Therefore, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it is important to develop accurate models and estimation methods of
ionospheric parameters and the corresponding target tracking algorithms. In this paper, we consider the variation of the ionosphere
with location and the spatial correlation of the ionosphere in OTHR target tracking. We use a Gaussian Markov random eld (GMRF)
to model the VIHs, providing a more accurate representation of the VIHs for OTHR target tracking. Based on expectation-conditional
maximization and GMRF modeling of the VIHs, we propose a novel joint optimization solution, called ECM-GMRF, to perform
target state estimation, multipath data association and VIHs estimation simultaneously. In ECM-GMRF, the measurements from both
ionosondes and OTHR are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading to a better estimation of the VIHs which improves the accuracy of
data association and target state estimation, and vice versa. The simulation indicates the e

ectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

1. Introduction
On account of many advantages such as the ability to detect
and track targets at long ranges (typically 800 km to 3
;
000 km)
beyond the earth's horizon with comparatively low operation
cost, skywave over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) has become in-
creasingly important for both civil and military applications,
such as maritime reconnaissance and drug enforcement [
1
,
2
].
As a medium and acting as a reector for reecting electro-
magnetic waves, the earth's ionosphere makes OTHR break
the limitation of radar horizon. However, the propagation of
electromagnetic waves through the inherent complicated iono-
sphere brings about a coordinate registration (CR) [
3
] process
for OTHR target tracking, since target locations in ground coor-
dinate system (i.e., latitude and longitude) are needed but OTHR
receives measurements in slant coordinate system (i.e., slant
azimuth and slant range). To carry out CR, ionospheric parame-
ters that describe the geometric transformation between ground
coordinate system and slant coordinate system, such as virtual
ionospheric heights (VIHs), are required [
4
,
5
]. Location error
analysis of OTHR shows that inaccuracy of ionospheric param-
eters is a main source of the localization error of OTHR [
6
].
Accordingly, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it
is important to develop accurate models and estimation methods
for ionospheric parameters (e.g., VIHs) and the corresponding

target tracking algorithms. In this context, the existing OTHR
target tracking approaches can be classied into the following
four groups.
The approaches in the rst group assumed that each layer
of the ionosphere is an ideal mirror, and the VIH of each
layer is a known constant. Focusing on the multipath data
association problem caused by the multilayer structure of the
ionosphere, these approaches include the multipath proba-
bilistic data association (MPDA) [
4
], the multiple detection
multiple hypothesis tracker (MD-MHT) [
7
], the expectation-
maximization (EM)-based joint multipath data association
and state estimation (JMAE) [
8
], the multipath Bernoulli
lter (MPBF) [
9
], the multidetection probability hypothesis
density (MD-PHD) lter [
10
,
11
], and the multipath linear
multitarget integrated probabilistic data association (MP-LM-
IPDA) [12].
The second group, including [
13
] and [
14
], assumed that
the VIH of each layer is an unknown constant. This being the
case, it is necessary to exploit a joint optimization scheme that
solves target state estimation, multipath data association, and
VIHs identication. Specically, the former, [
13
], resorted to
sensor fusion of OTHR and a set of forward-based receivers;
the latter, [
14
], adopted a distributed expectation-conditional
maximization (ECM) framework.
The approaches in the third group made the assumption that
the VIH(s) of each layer is (are) a random variable or a ran-
dom process in time. The improvement of reliability on the

 approaches is achieved by incorporating the uncertainty of VIHs
into the tracking algorithms. Examples of this group include the
MPDA for uncertain coordinate registration (MPCR) where the
VIH of each layer follows a Gaussian distribution with known
mean and variance [
5
], the multi-hypothesis multipath track fu-
sion (MPTF) where VIHs evolve with a linear dynamics model
and Gaussian distribution [
15
], and the joint estimation of tar-
get state and the bias of VIHs where VIHs are summation of
known, nominal VIHs provided by ionosondes and unknown,
time-varying bias [
16
,
17
]. In [
16
], by introducing the intermit-
tently evolving dynamic model for the bias of VIHs, the joint
estimation problem was reformulated as a multi-rate state esti-
mation with random coe

cient matrices. In [
17
], modeling the
bias of VIHs via a Markovian jump model, the joint estimation
problem was converted to pure state estimate with stochastic
parameters by embedding the data association in the resultant
measurement model with random coe

cients. Bo th of the two
joint estimation problems were solved by the deduced linear min-
imum mean square error estimator with causality constraints.
Few work, belongs to the fourth group, considered full iono-
spheric models. The parameters of the full ionospheric models,
for example, critical frequency, height at the base of the layer
and at the top, were assumed to be known. In [
18
,
19
], the multi-
quasi-parabolic model was used in CR of OTHR Nostradamus
target tracking. In [
20
], a maximum-likelihood probabilistic
multihypothesis tracker for OTHR was presented, where a 3-D
ionospheric regional model from the International Reference
Ionosphere (IRI) was used and the signal refraction in the iono-
sphere was modeled by ray-tracing.
The assumption of location independence of VIHs made by
the rst three groups signicantly simplied OTHR target track-
ing. However, it is far from being accurate since the ionosphere
is a spatiotemporal process. The VIHs of each layer in a large
region are apparently di

erent in di

erent locations. The work
of th e fourth group considered the location dependency of the
ionosphere through the full io nospheric models. However, the
properties of the ionosphere as a spatiotemporal process, such
as spatial correlation, were not fully considered.
Much work, especially on total electron contents (TECs) and
electron density, has shown that the ionosphere is spatially cor-
related. In the early stage, it was discovered that the ionosphere
is horizontally spatially correlated. In [
21
], it was found that
TECs are highly correlata ble in two locations separated by 13

in latitude and 5

in longitude. In [
22
], the spatial correlation
coe

cients of TECs was calculated, based on which it is pos-
sible to predict mid-latitude TECs behavior over separations of
up to 1200 km given a single TECs measurement. The corre-
lation for mid-latitude ionosphere over the Western U.S. was
showed in [
23
]. Later, the spatial correlation of the ionosphere
including both the horizontal and the vertical correlation was
investigated [
24
]. Krankowski et al. [
25
] summarized that the
correlation distance of ionosphere depends on direction and it
is anisotropic. Arikan [
26
] applied random eld theory to iono-
spheric electron density reconstruction problem and discussed
the choice of correlation functions. Minkwitz et al. [
27
] pro-
posed an approach that estimates the electron density's spatial
covariance model which reveals the di

erent correlation lengths
in latitude and longitude direction. Liu et al. [
28
] investigated the
horizontal spatial correlation of globally ionospheric TECs. The
correlation scale was compared from the aspects of direction,
latitude and season. Norberg et al. [
29
,
30
,
31
] proposed a new
ionospheric tomography method in Bayesian framework which
enables an interpretable scheme to build the prior distribution
based on physical and empirical information on the structure of
the ionosphere for 2D case [
29
,
30
] and 3D multi-instrument
case [
31
]. In ionospheric weather forecast, an accurate correla-
tion model of the ionosphere is used to constru ct background
eld error covariance matrix for data assimilation.
In this paper, we consider the variation of the ionosphere with
location and the spatial correlation of the ionosphere in OTHR
target tracking. Like the approaches of the rst three groups,
we use VIHs as the key parameters in CR. It is not unnatural to
assume that VIHs are location dependent. The assumption of
the spatial correlation of VIHs is based upon the s patial corre-
lation of the above-mentioned electron density and TECs, and
the dependence of VIHs on them. As an example of this depen-
dence, given an operating frequency of OTHR, VIHs are linear
with the height where electron density is maximum in parabolic
layer model [
32
]. Our purpose to consider the variation of the
ionosphere with location and the spatial correlation of the iono-
sphere is to create a model that more accurately represents the
ionosphere in OTHR target tracking and therefore improve the
localization error of OTHR. In practice, assuming a constant
VIH for the ionosphere will unavoidably br ing about a signif-
icant localization error for OTHR. To estimate VIHs online, a
network of available ionosondes, including, for example, verti-
cal ionosondes, quasi-vertical ionosondes, oblique ionosondes,
are deploy ed [
3
]. However, since the deployment of ionoson-
des is restricted to available areas and costs operators capital
expenditures and operating expenses, meas urements of V IHs on
very limited locations are obtained. By considering the spatial
correlation of VIHs, we are able to infer or predict the VIHs of
the ionosphere acting as a reection area more accurately.
We use a discrete Gaussian Markov random eld (GMRF) to
model the variation of VIHs with location and the spatial corre-
lation of VIHs. Based on this model, we then propose a joint
tracking algorithm using ECM-based technique for joint data
association, target state estimation, and VIHs identication. In
this algorithm, we use not only the measurements of VIHs from
ionosondes but also the measurements of targets from OTHR
to estimate VIHs since the latter also include the information
on VIHs. By modeling VIHs as a GMRF, we are able to infer
the VIHs at the locations where the signal reection occurs for
a given target. A better estimation of VIHs can improve the
accuracy of data association and target state estimation, and
vice versa. As pointed out in [
14
], joint data association and
target state estimation are e

ective for dealing with the coupling
issue of identication risks and estimation errors [
14
]. Note
that [

] considered the single target tracking. In summary, the
contributions of this paper beyond [14] are as follows:
1.
For the rst time, we consider the variation of the iono-
sphere with location and the spatial correlation of iono-
sphere in OTHR target tracking. We use GMRF to model
2
 the VIHs of the ionosphere, providing a more accurate
representation of VIHs for OTHR target tracking.
2.
Using ECM, we propose a joint multitarget tracking frame-
work for data association, target state estimation and VIHs
estimation. Leveraging GMRF modeling of the VIHs of
the ionosphere, we use both the ionosonde measurements
and the radar measurements to estimate the target state and
the VIHs, improving target localization accuracy of OTHR.
Our preliminary work was presented in [
33
] and has been sub-
stantially extended in this study. In [
33
], we to ok into account of
spatial correlation of the VIHs and inferred the posterior distribu-
tion of the VIHs based on GMRF. Then, the estimated VIHs was
passed to the existing MPCR algorithm for single target tracking.
In this paper, we integrate the propose d VIHs model with the
ECM framework, where radar measurements are also utilized
to estimate VIHs. Additionally, the multitarget multi-detection
pattern is presented for multitarget data association. The de-
tailed imp le mentation for inferring the posterior distribution of
the VIHs over large scale regions is also presented.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
consists of the assumptions and models for OTHR target tracking.
The detailed derivation of the proposed algorithm, ECM-GMRF,
is depicted in Section 3. Simulation results are presented in
Section 4 followed by concluding remarks in Section 5.

2. Models and problem formulation
In this section, we describe the models we introduce for VIHs,
ionosonde measurements, target dynamics, and radar measure-
ment. Based on the models, we provide a formulation of our
OTHR multitarget multipath tracking problem.
2.1. Model of VIHs
Without loss of generality, a two-layer (E and F) spherical
mirror ionosphere is assumed. The ionosphere region to be used
for signal reection depends on the wide surveillance area of
OTHR, and is correspondingly large. The VIHs at di

erent
locations are di

erent due to the di

erent characteristics of the
earth's magnetic eld [
34
]. Based upon the existing work on the
ionospheric spatial correlation [
21
,
35
,
27
] (See more details in
Section 1), we assume that there exists horizontal correlation of
VIHs but do not consider the vertical correlation of VIHs for
simplicity. Since, in short time periods, the correlation strength
of the ionosphere at two di

erent sites la rgely depends on the
distance between them, which corresponds to the local Markov
property [
36
], VIHs can be modeled as a Markov random eld.
As described in [
29
,
30
,
31
], which assumed that electron density
and TECs are Gaussian, we assume that the VIHs are Gaussian
as well. Accordingly, we use a discrete Gaussian Markov ran-
dom eld (GMRF) to describe the VIHs of both E layer and F
layer.
Specically, we take E layer as an example to illustrate our
GMRF description of VIHs. We associate E layer with an undi-
rected graph
G
=
(
V
;
E
), where
V
=
f
1
;
2
; : : : ;
N
g
is the set of
nodes in the graph, and
E
is the set of edges (
i
;
j
),
i
;
j
2 V
and
i
,
j
. Denote
h
i
2
R
+
;
i
2 V
as the VIH of E layer at site
i
.
Henceforth,
N
is the number of sites of E layer. Let
h

.
We assume that


is the covariance matrix. Let

and

are
called precision matrix and potential vector, respectively. The
random vector of VIHs

and
Q

,

for all

. Therefore, two
VIHs at two di

erent sites
i
and
j
are spatially correlated if there
exists an edge
e
=
(
i

)
2 E
and vice versa. For a GMRF, it is
often more convenient to work with the canonical (information)
form, which is dened as [37]

In principle, the priors of the GMRF model, including the
mean vector

, the covariance matrix

, the potential vector

, and the precision matrix
Q
, can be learned from historical
measurements of VIHs by the standard maximum likelihood
estimator. However, for a large-scale sparse precision matrix
Q
,
one may need more e

ective learning method [
38
]. We leave
the learning of the GMRF model as our future work and assume
that the priors are given in this paper.
2.2. Model of ionosonde measurement
The vertical incidence ionospheric sounding and the oblique
incidence ionospheric sounding are two typical types of ionoson-
des. We assume that OTHR measurement and ionosonde mea-
surement are synchronized. By assuming stationary electron
density for the given time interval [
31
], the ionosonde measure-
ments of each site of each layer can be written as,
z
s
i
;
k
=
g
(
h
s
i
;
k
)
+
v
s
k
;
s
=
E, F and
i
=
1
; : : : ;
N
;
(3)
where
z
s
i
;
k
is the time delay. It is assumed that
v
s
k
is a zero mean
Gaussian noise, i.e.,
v
s
k
˘ N
(0
;
A
s
k
). The measurement function
g
(

) depends on the type of ionosondes. For a vertical incidence
ionosonde, the measurement is linearly related to the VIHs [
39
],
g
(
h
)
=
2
h
c
;
(4)
where
c
is the light speed. For an oblique incidence ionosonde
with a simplied model of a at ionosphere over a at Earth, the
measurement function is [40],
g
(
h
)
=
2
p
h
2
+
(
¯
d
=
2)
2
c
;
(5)
3
 where
¯
d
is the distance from the transmitter of the ionosonde to
the receiver of the ionosonde.
We here emphasize that because of the wide-area surveil-
lance of OTHR, the geographical limitation of the placement of
ionosondes, and the construction and operation cost of ionoson-
des, only some sites of the ionosphere are measured by ionoson-
des. The required VIHs may not be measured directly by the
ionosondes. We will discuss this later in Section 3.4.
2.3. Model of target dynamics
Assume that there are
L
targets in the surveillance area of
OTHR. The state of target
l
(
l
=
1
; : : : ;
L
) at scan
k
is written
as

T
, corresponding to ground range, ground
range rate, bearing and bearing rate of the target. The dynamics
of each target is assumed to follow a d is crete-time state equation
written as

2.4. Model of OTHR measurement
With two ionospheric layers E and F, there are four one-hop
propagation modes, EE, EF, FE and FF. For each mode, we as-
sume that the measurement of a target is obtained independently
with known detection probability

in Eq. (8) are replaced with the VIHs at the
sites where OTHR beam reects from the transmitter to the
target and the receiving beam reects from the target to the
receiver, respectively.
As [
4
], we assume that clutter distributes uniformly in the
region of interest and the number of clutter follows a Poisson
distribution with density

. For a given number of false clutter
measurements

2.5. Problem statement
Taking EF propagation mode as an example, Fig. 2 depicts
the synthesis of our models on VIHs, ionosonde measurement,
target and OTHR measurement. Unlike the existing OTHR track-
ing algorithms mentioned in Section 1, we rene the description
of VIHs by dividing each layer of the ionosphere into smaller
subregions and modeling it by a GMRF. As we mentioned in
Section 2.2, a very limited number of subregions are observed by
ionosondes. The subregions where the OTHR signal is reected
may not be observed by any ionosondes. By modeling the VIHs
of each layer as a GMRF, we are able to infer the VIHs of un-
observed subregions and improve the estimation of the VIHs of
observed sub regions by jointly using both OTHR measurements
and ionosonde measurements, leading to the reduction of the
VIHs error and the improvement of target state estimation in
return.

i

denotes the
subregion where the OTHR beam reects from the transmitter to
the target, and
i

denotes the subregion where the OTHR beam
reects from the target to the receiver. As shown in Fig. 1,
i
t
and
i
r
are determined by geometric transforms among radar sta-
tions, target location and VIHs. The indexing of the subregions
corresponding to each propagation mode is shown in Table 1.
Given the models of VIHs, ionosonde measurement, target
dynamics, and radar measurement, the aim of a tracker is to

In Problem 1, there are two di

culties that prevent it from
being solved directly. The rst one is the unknown data associ-
ation (called
missing data
)

k


:
k
, that is, the correspondence
among a target, a measurement and a propagation path is not
known. This means that the radar measurement is
incomplete
data
. The second one is the above-mentioned coupling of the
target state and the used VIHs. EM, which works iteratively, is
an e

ective way to deal with the MAP estimation problem with
missing data [
41
]. Each iteration of EM involves an expecta-
tion step (E-step), which creates a function for the expectation
of the log-likelihood evaluated using current estimation for the
parameters, and a maximization step (M-step), which computes
parameters by maximizing the function formulated in the E-step.
EM has provided performance improvement for OTHR target
tracking [
42
,
8
,
14
] although the GMRF model of VIHs was not
considered. In this paper, we leverage EM framework as well
and develop the OTHR multitarget tracking algorithm. We next
will describe the details of the proposed algorithm.
3. OTHR multitarget tracking
As we mentioned in Section 2.5, in the EM framework, OTHR
measurements are incomplete data due to the unknown data
association. Both OTHR measurements and ionosonde mea-
surements contain the information on the used VIHs. For a
clear representation, below we rename each variables in the EM
framework:

Step 6:
Check for the convergence of either the parameters
or the log likelihood. If the convergence criterion is not
fullled, let
r
=

The goal of the M-step (i.e.,
Step 5
) is to maximize Eq. (14)
over parameters
x
k

k
and

k

To this end, the diagram of our proposed algorithm, ECM-
GMRF, is shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, the modules in orange
dotted box represent the entire ECM process. The E-step, in-
cluding the using of multitarget multidetection pattern and the
calculation of the posterior distribution of each association event,
is represented by
data association
block. The
target state esti-
mation

CM-step. The red dotted box represents the second step of the
CM-step, i.e., Eq. (16).

tion 3.1. Next we will specify the derivation of E-step in Sec-
tion 3.2. Then we will elaborate the above two CM-steps, i.e.,
target state estimation and inference of VIHs, in Section 3.3 and
Section 3.4, respectively.
3.1. Data association
In OTHR, the data association uncertainties include the un-
known number of target-originated measurements for each tar-
get, the unknown measurement source as well as the unknown
measurement mode. We here extend the multidetection pat-
tern in [
45
] to multitarget case. The multitarget multidetection
pattern is formulated with the following assumptions:

One measurement can only be associated with at most one
target through a propagation mode.

For each target, at most one measurement can be generated
through a propagation mode.
Assume that there are
N
m
;
k
OTHR measurements at scan
k
.
For the sake of simplicity, we omit the time subscript in the
following description within th is subsection. We have following
denitions.
Denition 1.
For each target
l
(
l
=
1
; : : : ;
L
)
, dene the number
of target-originated measurements from target
l
as
'
l
(
'
l

0

1
; : : : ; '
l
max
)
:

ﬁ
'
l
=
0ﬂ
: the target exists, but no OTHR measurement is
from target l ;

ﬁ
'
l
>
0ﬂ
: the target exists, and
'
l
out of
N
m
;
k
OTHR mea-
surements are originated from target l ,
where
'
l
max
equals the number of propagation modes that can be
associated with OTHR measurements.
To reduce the computational cost of the data association, the
validation gate can be adopted for each propagation mode. For a
certain propagation mode

elliptical gate is [5],

represent the measurement prediction and
innovation covariance of target
l

, respectively,
and are given by Eq. (35) and Eq. (36) later. The scalar constants
V

are chosen to make the gate probability, namely, the proba-
bility that
y
lies in the gate equal to
p
 ;
l
g
[

gate,

the denition of association instance for each single target, the
association event for all targets is given as follows.
Denition 3
(Association event for all targets)
.
One of the fea-
sible association event for all targets is dened as

'

n

L
[

'
l

with the constraint that there is no repeated element in vector

%

)
and
%
l
=
(
%

.
The constraints in Denition 2 and Denition 3 ensure that
the assumptions at the beginning of this subsection are fullled.
Accordingly, the event space of data association

is

lation of the

To maximize Eq. (47)

:

, we need to infer the posterior
marginal distribution of the each used VIH; this is a typical infer-
ence problem on probabilistic graphical models. For Gaussian
graphical models of moderate size, exact inference can be solved
by algorithms such as direct matrix inversion, Choles ky factor-
ization, and nested dissection. However, these algorithms cannot
be used for large-scale problems due to the computational com-
plexity [
49
]. Exploiting the structure of the GMRF, the
message
passing
approach can signicantly reduce the computational
cost and is adopted to infer the VIHs.
Fig. 4 shows the message passing ow for the used VIHs for
one target. The VIH of E layer and the VIH of F layer are linked
through the OTHR measurements generated by propagation
mode EF and FE. We combine two GMRFs into one, i.e.,
E
=
fE

[ E

4. Simulation and analysis
In this section, numerical simulations are implemented to
verify the performance of ECM-GMRF. We compare ECM-
GMRF with MD-JPDAF [
45
]. The statistical results of the two
algorithms are based on 400 Monte Carlo runs.
4.1. Scenario settings
As shown in Fig. 1, we use the same settings for OTHR as
described in [
4
], such as surveillance region size, measurement
noise level and sampling period. We assume that there are ve
targets in the surveillance region of OTHR. Fig. 5 shows the true
trajectories of the ve targets in radar ground coordinate system.
To model the ionosphere by a GMRF, without loss of general-
ity, for each layer of the ionosphere, we divide the corresponding
ionosphere region
A
into 144 subregions as illustrated in Fig. 6.
The subregions of the used VIHs are determined by the geometry
of the CR shown in Fig. 1. For each target, the locations and
the indices (E layer and F layer) of the subregions of the used
VIHs are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. To directly
measure VIHs, we assume that there are two vertical incidence
ionospheric sounding ionosondes which are located underneath
the subregion 1 and the subregion 73, respectively. Table 2
shows the parameters of the scenario and the initial states of all
targets.

Next, we rst run ECM-GMRF only to analyze its perfor-
mance considering a single target (e.g., Target 1) tracking in
Section 4.2. Then we explore the improvements of the used
VIH estimation and the target state estimation when multiple
targets are tracked, and compare ECM-GMRF with MD-JPDAF
in Section 4.3.
4.2. Single target tracking results
Firstly, we let

(slide window) of ECM-GMRF be one and
consider the following three cases with di

erent information
sources on VIHs.

Case 1: The VIHs of layer E and layer F are xed at 110 km
and 220 km, respectively.

Case 2: Only the measurements from ionosondes are used
to estimate the used VIHs.

Case 3: Both the measurements from ionosondes and the
measurements from OTHR are used to estimate the used
VIHs.
The statistical results of VIHs estimation and target state esti-
mation obtained by ECM-GMRF are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9,
respectively. For comparison, the results of VIHs estimation
and target state estimation with true data association are also
presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.
From Fig. 8, it is seen that using ionosonde measure-
ments (Case 2 and Case 3) can signicantly reduce the estimation
error of VIHs comparing with using constant VIHs (Case 1). By
observing the RMSE curves of VIHs of Case 2 and Case 3, it is

concluded that, as we expected, using the additional measure-
ments of the target from OTHR can improve the estimation of
VIHs as well, especially for
h
F
(
i
t
)
and
h
F
(
i
r
)
. The di

erence
in the increase of the used VIHs of the E layer and the F layer
is due to the di

erence in the values and parameters of the two
layers. For example, the linearization errors in Eq. (54) for mode
EE and mode FF are di

erent due to the di

erent values of the
two layers. The results in Fig. 8 verify our standpoints by the
following facts. The comparison between Case 1 and Case 2
shows that the correlation among the VIHs contributes to the
estimation of the used VIH. Fig. 6 shows that the used VIHs are
not directly measured by ionosondes. The comparison between
Case 2 and Case 3 shows that OTHR measurements are helpful
to the estimation of the used VIHs.
Figure 9: Statistical results of target state estimation with di

erent information
source on the VIHs: ground range (left panel) and bearing (right panel).
The RMSE curves of VIHs of Case 3 with true data asso-
ciation and gate data association indicate that erroneous data
association indeed occurred to ECM-GMRF using gate data as-
sociation and it can deteriorate the estimation performance of
ECM-GMRF on VIHs. Note that since the temporal correlation
of VIHs is not considered in this p aper, the estimation accuracy
of VIHs has not been improved with the accumulation of (both
OTHR and ionosonde) measurements over time.
12
 By observing the RMSE curves of ground range and bearing
for all the three cases in Fig. 9 and the above analysis of VIHs
estimation based on Fig. 8, we conclude that better estimation of
VIHs is benecial to target state estimation. The mean RMSE of
the ground range of the three cases using gate data association
are 1.97 km, 1.44 km and 1.3 km, respectively; the improvement
ratio of Case 2 and Case 3 over Case 1 are 26.7% and 33.7%,
respectively. Overall, joint estimation of target state and VIHs
using both OTHR measurements and ionosonde measurements
can greatly improve the estimation accuracy of the used VIHs
as well as the target state.
Next, the performance of ECM-GMRF with di

erent se-
quence length

is explored. We run ECM-GMRF on Case
3 with gate data association. The statistical results of target state
estimation and the used VIHs estimation are shown in Fig. 10
and Fig. 11, from which it can be seen that as

increases, the
accuracy of target state estimation increases since more measure-
ments have been used. When

=
30, the RMSE of the ground
range of the target approaches 1 km. Note that a greater

means
a greater output delay of a tracker.

4.3. Multitarget tracking results
In order to compare ECM-GMRF with MD-JPDAF and verify
the performance improvement on a target brought by using the
OTHR measurements of other targets which is achieved indi-
rectly by the improved VIHs used by the target, we consider the
following three cases.

Case 4: MD-JPDAF is performed for target tracking. The
VIHs of layer E and layer F are xed at 110 km and 220 km,
respectively.

Case 5: Each target is tracked individually using ECM-
GMRF.

Case 6: All the targets are tracked simultaneously using
ECM-GMRF.
The parameter settings remain unchanged in Table 2 and

=
30
for ECM-GMRF.
Fig. 12 shows the comparison of the used VIHs estimation
obtained by ECM-GMRF for each target under Case 5, Case
6 and the case that only ionosonde measurements are used to
estimate the used VIHs. In Fig. 12, the green curves represent
the RMSE of the estimated VIHs by only using ionosonde mea-
surements
Z
, the red curves represent the RMSE of the estimated
VIHs by using ionosonde measurements
Z
and OTHR measure-
ments
Y
when targets are tracked individually (i.e., Case 5), and
the blue curves represent the RMSE of the estimated VIHs by
using ionosonde measurements
Z
and OTHR measurements
Y
when targets are tracked simultaneously. From Fig. 12, it is seen
that comparing with only using ionosonde measurements, using
both ionosonde measurements and OTHR measurements can
improve the estimation of VIHs, especially when all the targets
are tracked simultaneously since OTHR measurements of all
targets are used to infer the used VIHs through the GMRF model.
In the GMRF model we constructed, the closer the subregions
are, the stronger the correlation is. As we can see from Fig. 5,
the targets move toward the same point and they are very close
around scan 15 as well as the VIHs. Correspondingly, the lowest
value of the estimated RMSE of VIHs when tracking simulta-
neously (i.e., the green curve) in Fig. 12 is at around scan 15.
Table 3 shows the RMSE mean values (km) of each curves of
30 scans in Fig. 12, and the improvement ratios compared with
the standard deviations of the VIHs.
For the evaluation of target tracking accuracy, Fig. 13 depicts
the RMSEs for the range estimation and bearing estimation of
the targets under di

erent cases. As we can see in Fig. 13, for all
targets, the estimation result of Case 6 is the best. The tracking
accuracy of Case 5 is slightly worse than that of Case 6. Using
the OTHR measurements of targets simultaneously can improve
the tracking accuracy up to 9
:
95% for all targets averagely. ECM-
GMRF performs better than MD-JPDAF (Case 4) under both
Case 5 and Case 6. The smoother in the ECM-GMRF improves
the tracking accuracy. Intuitively, since the target state and the
VIHs are coupled in the radar measurement function, accurate
estimation of the VIHs leads to improvement of the target state
estimation.

5. Conclusion
We have addressed the problem of OTHR target state esti-
mation and VIHs identication taking account of the variation
of the VIHs with location and the spatial correlation of the
VIHs. We have used GMRF to model the VIHs. The prob-
lem has been formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation
problem based on both OTHR measurements and ionosonde
measurements. By applying ECM, we have proposed a joint
joint optimization algorithm to perform target state estimation,
multipath data association and VIHs estimation simultaneously.
In our proposed algorithm, both ionosonde measurements and
OTHR measurements are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading
to the reduction of the VIHs error and the improvement of target
state estimation in return. For future work, we plan to develop
learning algorithms for the GMRF model and investigate the

Title: Bianchi type VI1 cosmological model with wet dark fluid in scale
  invariant theory of gravitation
Authors: Mishra B.;Sahoo P.
DOI: 10.1007/s10509-013-1652-6
Abstract :
In this paper, we have investigated Bianchi type VIh, II and III cosmological model with wet dark fluid in scale invariant theory of gravity, where the matter field is in the form of perfect fluid and with a time dependent gauge function (Dirac gauge). A non-singular model for the universe filled with disorder radiation is constructed and some physical behaviors of the model are studied for the feasible VIh (h = 1) space-time.

Title: Multiwavelength Observations of the Black Hole Candidate XTE J1550-564
  during the 2000 Outburst
Authors: Jain R.;Bailyn C.;Orosz J.;McClintock J.;Remillard R.
DOI: 10.1086/321700
Abstract :
We report optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves for the outburst, in 2000, of the black hole candidate XTE J1550-564. We find that the start of the outburst in the H and V bands precedes that seen in the RXTE All Sky Monitor by 11.5 +/- 0.9 and 8.8 +/- 0.6 days, respectively; a similar delay has been observed in two other systems. About 50 days after the primary maxima in the VIH light curves, we find secondary maxima, most prominently in H. This secondary peak is absent in the X-ray light curve, but coincides with a transition to the low/hard state. We suggest that this secondary peak may be due to non-thermal emission associated with the formation of a jet.

Title: Late-time behaviour of the tilted Bianchi type VIh models
Authors: Hervik S;Hoogen R;Lim W;Coley A
DOI: 10.1088/0264-9381/24/15/007
Abstract :
We study tilted perfect fluid cosmological models with a constant equation of state parameter in spatially homogeneous models of Bianchi type VI_h using dynamical systems methods and numerical experimentation, with an emphasis on their future asymptotic evolution. We determine all of the equilibrium points of the type VI_h state space (which correspond to exact self-similar solutions of the Einstein equations, some of which are new), and their stability is investigated. We find that there are vacuum plane-wave solutions that act as future attractors. In the parameter space, a `loophole' is shown to exist in which there are no stable equilibrium points. We then show that a Hopf-bifurcation can occur resulting in a stable closed orbit (which we refer to as the Mussel attractor) corresponding to points both inside the loophole and points just outside the loophole; in the former case the closed curves act as late-time attractors while in the latter case these attracting curves will co-exist with attracting equilibrium points. In the special Bianchi type III case, centre manifold theory is required to determine the future attractors. Comprehensive numerical experiments are carried out to complement and confirm the analytical results presented. We note that the Bianchi type VI_h case is of particular interest in that it contains many different subcases which exhibit many of the different possible future asymptotic behaviours of Bianchi cosmological models.

Title: The Inclination of the Soft X-ray Transient A0620--00 and the Mass of
  its Black Hole
Authors: Cantrell Andrew;Bailyn Charles;Orosz Jerome;McClintock Jeffrey;Remillard Ronald;Froning Cynthia;Neilsen Joseph;Gelino Dawn;Gou Lijun
DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/710/2/1127
Abstract :
We analyze photometry of the Soft X-ray Transient A0620-00 spanning nearly 30 years, including previously published and previously unpublished data. Previous attempts to determine the inclination of A0620 using subsets of these data have yielded a wide range of measured values of i. Differences in the measured value of i have been due to changes in the shape of the light curve and uncertainty regarding the contamination from the disk. We give a new technique for estimating the disk fraction and find that disk light is significant in all light curves, even in the infrared. We also find that all changes in the shape and normalization of the light curve originate in a variable disk component. After accounting for this disk component, we find that all the data, including light curves of significantly different shapes, point to a consistent value of i. Combining results from many separate data sets, we find i=51 plus or minus 0.9 degrees, implying M=6.6 plus or minus 0.25 solar masses. Using our dynamical model and zero-disk stellar VIH magnitudes, we find d=1.06 plus or minus 0.12 kpc. Understanding the disk origin of non-ellipsoidal variability may assist with making reliable determinations of i in other systems, and the fluctuations in disk light may provide a new observational tool for understanding the three-dimensional structure of the accretion disk.

Title: Reproducibility in high-throughput density functional theory: a
  comparison of AFLOW, Materials Project, and OQMD

Abstract :
A central challenge in high throughput density functional theory (HT-DFT) calculations is selecting a combination of input parameters and post-processing techniques that can be used across all materials classes, while also managing accuracy-cost tradeoffs. To investigate the effects of these parameter choices, we consolidate three large HT-DFT databases: Automatic-FLOW (AFLOW), the Materials Project (MP), and the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), and compare reported properties across each pair of databases for materials calculated using the same initial crystal structure. We find that HT-DFT formation energies and volumes are generally more reproducible than band gaps and total magnetizations; for instance, a notable fraction of records disagree on whether a material is metallic (up to 7%) or magnetic (up to 15%). The variance between calculated properties is as high as 0.105 eV/atom (median relative absolute difference, or MRAD, of 6%) for formation energy, 0.65 {\AA}$^3$/atom (MRAD of 4%) for volume, 0.21 eV (MRAD of 9%) for band gap, and 0.15 $\mu_{\rm B}$/formula unit (MRAD of 8%) for total magnetization, comparable to the differences between DFT and experiment. We trace some of the larger discrepancies to choices involving pseudopotentials, the DFT+U formalism, and elemental reference states, and argue that further standardization of HT-DFT would be beneficial to reproducibility.
